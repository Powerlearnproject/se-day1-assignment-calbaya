Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the process of designing, testing and maintaining software.
It helps to create softwares that are user-friendly and meets user's needs.
It also helps companies optimise their operations, streamline processes and gain a competitive edge.
Software engineering also helps businesses manage their data efficiently, analyse customer patterns and make informed decisions that drive growth, sustainability and profitability.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Mastering Machine (1956-1967). Hardware dependent high level languages.
Mastering Process (1968-1982). Development of process software engineering.
Mastering Complexity (1983-1992). Sructured. Personal computer. Expanding data and functional convergence.
Mastering Communications (1993-2001). Internet. Srver complex projects.
Mastering Productivity(2002-2010). Conceptual level expansion. Customer productivity and involvement.
Mastering Market(2011-...). Oursourcing services.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
a) Planning.
Defines the project scope, objectives and feasibility.
b) Requirement Analysis.
Gathers and documents software requirements from stakeholders
c) Design.
Architects the system structure and and system components.
d) Implementation (Coding).
Developer writes the actual codes based on design specifications.
e) Testing. 
Detects and fixes bugs through unit, integration, system and user acceptance testing.
f) Deployment.
Release the software for productive use.
g) Maintenance.
Provides ongoing support, updates and bug fixes.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Differences.
a) Structure. Waterfall follows a strict step by step process while Agile is adaptive and iterative.
b) Change handling. Waterfall struggles with changes once development starts while Agile accomodates changes easily.
c) Delivery. Waterfall delivers a complete product at the end while Agile delivers small, functional parts frequently.

Simmilarities.
a) Both aim to produce high quality software efficiently
b) Both require team collaboration and planning to be successful.

Scenario Examples.
Waterfall methodology - Best for structured, predictable projects. For example, building a banking system, government projects.
Agile methodology - Best for dynamic, fast-paced projects. For example, developing a mobile or web application.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer. Responsible for designing, coding and maintaining software applications. 
Quality Assurance Engineer. Ensures the software meets quality standards and functions correctly before deployment.
Project Manager. Oversees the software development process, ensuring it stays on schedule and within budget.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Importance of IDEs
a) Increase productivity. Features like code completion and debugging tools help developers write code faster
b) Reduce errors. Builtin linters and debugging tools help catch errors early
c) Enhance collaboration
d) Provides code management
e) Integrates with other tools
Examples of IDEs include: Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, Pycharm.

Importance of VCS
a) Facilitates collaboration
b) Tracks changes
c) Reduce risk
d) Supports branching and merging
e) Improves deployment process
Examples of VCS include: Git, GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Challenges
a) Changing Requirements: Requirements may change during the development cycle, leading to scope creep and project delays.
b) Tight Deadlines: Pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed development and compromised quality.
c) Technical Debt: Accrued from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions, technical debt can impede future development efforts and increase maintenance costs.

Strategies.
Strategies for Overcoming Challenges: Strategies for overcoming challenges include effective communication, agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks, and regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.



Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
 Unit Testing: Testing individual components or modules of software.
 Integration Testing: Testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
 System Testing: Testing the entire software system as a whole.
 Acceptance Testing: Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.
Importance of Quality Control: Quality control measures such as code reviews, automated testing, and continuous integration help identify and fix defects early in the development process, leading to higher-quality software products.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is all about crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models. 



Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Instead of saying "The history of Kenya" you could say "The history of Kenya in the fight for independence"
Prompt is effective to give more accurate and precise answer.
